# Hardhat Frontend Using Localhost

This project connects a React-based frontend to a Hardhat-powered Ethereum smart contract. The frontend interacts with the deployed smart contracts through `localhost`.

## 🔗 Live Frontend

## ⚙️ Project Structure

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- **Frontend**: Built with React, communicates with Hardhat's local network or testnets via MetaMask

## 🚫 Backend Status

⚠️ **Backend is currently not working** because the required testnet faucet (used to fund testnet accounts) is **not available**.  
Once faucet support resumes or a different testnet is selected, backend contract interaction will be restored.

## 🛠️ Getting Started Locally
